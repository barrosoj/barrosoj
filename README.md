# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hello! I'm João, currently working as CloudOps specializing in GitHub Automations for in-house and Cloud adoption projects. <br><br>🌟 Since I shifted gears and started working in IT, around 4 years ago, I've had several experiences with Cloud migration projects and am currently dedicated to optimizing cloud infrastructure and development workflows through the power of automation in GitHub.<br><br>🌐 Throughout my career, I've been fortunate to collaborate on diverse projects. Currently my main focus is to help teams harness the full potential of GitHub Actions and cloud technologies to accelerate their operations.<br><br>🌍 When I'm not diving into automation, you can find me diving in the Oceans of the world. As a PADI IDC Staff Instructor I keep my passion side-by-side with my work. <br><br> 🌊From the Ocean to the Cloud!☁️
